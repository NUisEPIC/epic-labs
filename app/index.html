                    <h4>What is EPIC Labs?</h4>
                    <p>EPIC Labs is a startup accelerator focused on teaching student entrepreneurs the skills of developing a web technology startup. Don’t fret if you don’t have any technical experience! Our mission is to fill the critical gap for startups at the earliest stages - resources, guidance, and infrastructure. Our entrepreneurs work side-by-side with our mentors, enabling them to build and launch their ventures into exceptional businesses. Startups go through a structured 3 month program that provides them access to any resources they would ever need, from a deep mentor network to entrepreneurial minded peers, to jumpstart their entrepreneurial journey.</p>

                <div class = "row">
                    <h4>Why EPIC Labs?</h4>
                    <p>Students often feel like they don’t have the resources of creating a startup. Thus, EPIC labs aims to guide students to tackle the hurdles that limit the growth of their ideas. At the end of the program, we want students to become real entrepreneurs as they learn various skills and develop their own startup.</p>
                </div>
                <div class = "row">
                    <h4>What does EPIC Labs do for me?</h4>
                    <p>EPIC Labs will provide you with the resources and education to help you turn your idea into reality. Participants will learn the technical skills necessary to build their product, hear from members of the Chicago entrepreneurial community on what it takes to be successful, and receive a small stipend to help them cover the costs of getting started.</p>

                <div class = "row">
                    <h4>Can anyone apply?</h4>
                    <p>Both teams and individuals can apply, with the requirement that at least one member be a current student at Northwestern University. We will expect individuals to form or join a team within the first few weeks of the program.
					If you do not have an idea but are interested in the program, please contact us and we can discuss this further.</p>

                <div class = "row">
                    <h4>What are the program expectations?</h4>
                    <p>Teams will work over the course of the program on their startups and meet once every week for roughly 2 hours, starting February 4, 2015. All team members are expected to be at every meeting. Each team will be responsible for completing the assigned deliverables each week.</p>
                </div>
                <div class = "row">
                    <h4>Do I need to know how to code to apply?</h4>
                    <p>No, students who do not have the technical skills will be given the resources necessary to learn how to build their product.</p>

                <div class = "row">
                    <h4>What kind of products can I build?</h4>
                    <p>At this time we are only accepting teams and individuals who are seeking to build web or mobile apps, as well as services based largely on web or mobile technologies. If you are unsure whether or not your idea fits into this category, send us an email at contact@nuisepic.com and we will let you know!</p>

                    <h4>I’ve heard about Project Pitch, but how is this different?
</h4>
					<p>We consider EPIC Labs to be the next step after Project Pitch. Whereas the mission of Project Pitch is to introduce students to entrepreneurship, EPIC Labs develops students by doing – we’re asking students to actually build their own products. Through this process, EPIC Labs develops students by guiding them grow and build their own businesses. </p>
